lab, all but one of the 95% confidence intervals overlap the red line marking the true mean. This is to be expected: since we're generating a 95% confidence interval, we would expect after repeatedly sampling and calculating confidence intervals that 95% of the confidence intervals calculated would contain the true population mean, while 5% would not.\n","\n","It won't always turn out at exactly 1 out of 20 like this (just like flipping a coin twice won't always give you 1 heads and 1 tails), but this particular example turned out nicely."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Summary\n","\n","In this lab, we learned how to use confidence intervals when the population standard deviation is not known, and the sample size is small (<30). Specifically, we constructed confidence intervals \"by hand\" using the t-critical value and margin of error, then saw how to use `stats.t.interval` instead. We also demonstrated an example of multiple samples being taken and confidence intervals being calculated, and how this relates to the 95% confidence level.
